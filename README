NAME
    App::Pocosi - A command line tool for launching a
    POE::Component::Server::IRC instance

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides a generic way to launch a
    POE::Component::Server::IRC instance.

    *   Prints useful status information (to your terminal and/or a log
        file)

    *   Will daemonize if you so wish

    *   Supports a configuration file

    *   Offers a user friendly way to pass arguments to
        POE::Component::Server::IRC

    *   Has an interactive mode where you can issue issue commands and call
        methods on the IRC component(s).

    The configuration file is in YAML or JSON format. It consists of a hash
    containing the options described in the above code example. Only
    "config" is required.

  "lib"
    Either the name of a directory containing Perl modules (e.g. plugins),
    or an array of such names. Kind of like Perl's *-I*.

  "pid_file"
    Path to a pid file, as used by most daemons. If is specified,
    App::Pocosi will refuse to run if the file already exists.

  "log_file"
    Path to a log file to which status messages will be written.

  "class"
    The IRC server component class. Defaults to
    POE::Component::Server::IRC::State.

  "config"
    This is a hash of various configuration variables for the IRCd. See
    PoCo-Server-IRC's "configure" for a list of parameters.

  "plugins"
    An array of arrays containing a short plugin class name (e.g.
    'OperServ') and optionally a hash of arguments to that plugin. When
    figuring out the correct package name, App::Pocosi will first try to
    load POE::Component::Server::IRC::Plugin::*YourPlugin* before trying to
    load *YourPlugin*.

  "listeners"
    An array of hashes. The keys should be any of the options listed in the
    docs for PoCo-Server-IRC-Backend's "add_listener" method.

  "auths"
    An array of hashes. The keys are described in the docs for
    PoCo-Server-IRC's "add_auth" method.

  "operators"
    An array of hashes. The keys are described in the docs for
    PoCo-Server-IRC's "add_operator" method. You you can supply an array of
    netmasks (the kind accepted by Net::Netmask's constructor) for the
    'ipmask' key.

  "peers"
    An array of hashes. The keys should be any of the options listed in the
    docs for PoCo-Server-IRC's "add_peer" method.

  "denials"
    An array of arrays. The first element of the inner array should be a
    netmask accepted by Net::Netmask's constructor. The second (optional)
    element should be a reason for the denial.

  "exemptions"
    An array of netmasks (the kind which Net::Netmask's constructor
    accepts).
